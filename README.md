# qemUI

**Repository has been archived. I initially worked on this because virt-manager and libvirt wouldn't work on my distro. Since I have switched and can now use libvirt, there is no use for me to update this project. Feel free to fork it in case you need it (doubt)**

**Graphical Interface application to run QEMU with ease.**
